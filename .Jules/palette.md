## 2024-05-23 - Hidden Focus Traps in Overlays
**Learning:** Elements hidden with `opacity-0` (like hover actions) are still focusable by keyboard, creating a confusing "invisible focus" state.
**Action:** Always add `focus-within:opacity-100` (or `group-focus-within` if needed) to the container when using `opacity-0` for hover effects on interactive elements.

## 2024-05-25 - Self-Contained Tooltips
**Learning:** The `Tooltip` component (`@/components/ui/tooltip`) includes its own `TooltipProvider`.
**Action:** Do not wrap the app in a global `TooltipProvider`; simply use `<Tooltip>` locally.

## 2024-05-27 - Focusable Disabled Buttons
**Learning:** Native `disabled` attribute removes buttons from keyboard tab order, disorienting users when a state changes (e.g., hitting stock limit).
**Action:** Use `aria-disabled="true"` with conditional styling and `onClick` guards to preserve focus and allow native tooltips (`title`).
